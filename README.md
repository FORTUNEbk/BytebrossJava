# Money comparison
This Java code defines a class called `MoneyOperations` with a nested class `money` that handles basic operations on two amounts of money, `money1` and `money2`. The `money` class has a constructor that initializes these amounts. It also provides three methods: `sum()`, which adds `money1` and `money2` and returns the result; `comparison()`, which compares the two amounts and returns the greater value while printing which one is greater; and `subtraction()`, which subtracts `money2` from `money1` and returns the result, but if the result is negative, it prints a warning and returns `0`. The `main` method demonstrates the use of the `money` class by creating an object `mon` with values `300` and `200` and calling these methods, printing the results to the console.
